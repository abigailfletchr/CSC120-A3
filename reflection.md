I felt okay about this assignment but didn't end up working with classmates on it. I was really busy with softball and driving someone to Boston, but I did talk to my girlfriend who is a cs major who helped me by explaining some Java syntax and she told me about array lists and other types of lists in java. Java takes a lot more steps than python, as in to do one thing in java you have to do a lot more.
A lot of the string methods from python are also in java, but there were also a lot of string methods that I couldn't find in java or they were more complicated or maybe just harder to search for.
It was hard to do the grammatical part of this assignment like when converting the words so I didn't aim for the kudos points. My advice for other students would be to start the assignment early.
