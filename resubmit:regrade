resubmit/regrade:
2/26/23

I am resubmiting HW 3 for a regrade because the program was
running an extra round because I was asking outside of the
loop. I made a change to fix this. I kept the question out
of the loop, however set the bounds for the loop to be one
less than the user inputs, therefore the first question is
accounted for.
